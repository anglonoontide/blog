        <p><em>Email sent to richard spencer summarising Doctor Who JEM...</em></p>
        <p>Hi Richard,</p>
        <p>
          I have recently understood that the popular British TV series of my childhood,
          'Doctor Who?', is an extravagant source of JEM, lending credence to Mark's
          several formulae for decoding Jewish symbols and notions of identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          --The exoteric-esoteric connections of 'Doctor Who?' are very often trivial,
          and so in a way it is insulting for me to explain them at length, instead of
          to simply encourage you and/or Mark to learn more of the show, for instance
          via the wiki <a href="#https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/" target="_blank">https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/</a>, but I will nevertheless give a
          brief summary here which features some of the most salient facts (where there
          is a Jewish symbol which, by now, is beneath explaining, I shall write
          '(read)'): 
        </p>
        <p>
          'Doctor Who?' is a show which follows a diasporic and messianic Jew 'The
          Doctor' who travels to various host societies across time and space to solve
          their problems. The show is so named because The Doctor does not reveal his
          true Jewish name to members of these societies ("The Doctor ... Doctor who?").
          He protects his identity including occasionally by operating in crypsis as a
          'John Smith' (read).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Doctor comes from a race of 'Time Lords' (read), from a planet known as
          'Gallifrey'. Gallifrey originates from the word gallimaufry<a id="ftnote-1-src" href="#ftnote-1">[1]</a> meaning "a
          confused jumble or medley of things" evoking racial admixture (read). Other
          names for the planet include Jewel, perhaps from 'Jew-El' (read), and 'Morning
          star' (read). Time Lord civilization was founded by 'Rasillion'<a id="ftnote-2-src" href="#ftnote-2">[2]</a>,
          'Omega'<a id="ftnote-3-src" href="#ftnote-3">[3]</a>, and 'The Other': Rasillion and Omega are solar engineers (read),
          and The Other, indicated as a previous form of The Doctor himself, reads as a
          form of Yaweh. Time Lord civilization was founded after the overthrow of the
          Pythia people (read!).<a id="ftnote-4-src" href="#ftnote-4">[4]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Doctor carries out his travels usually with a companion, usually English
          female, which he gathers from a host society (read). They travel in a vehicle
          known as the 'Tardis',<a id="ftnote-5-src" href="#ftnote-5">[5]</a> stolen from his people. The Tardis is a metaphor for
          Judaism. Most notoriously it is “bigger on the inside”, referring to Judaism's
          exoteric vs esoteric dimensions. It is hidden in plain sight and normal people
          don't see it by assumption that it's benign and uninteresting (read). Anybody
          who looks into the heart of the Tardis ultimately can't handle it.<a id="ftnote-6-src" href="#ftnote-6">[6]</a> In one
          plotline The Doctor's companion who does this becomes briefly a powerful being
          known as the 'Bad Wolf' (read). After the Doctor absorbs the energy she bears
          using a kiss, the Doctor is forced to regenerate. The Tardis and The Doctor
          and The Time Lords all have the power to regenerate, meaning to change their
          form while retaining an essence (read).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Doctor fights enemies/solves problems on his travels using primarily his
          words and intelligence (read), his Tardis, and his sonic screwdriver; his
          sonic screwdriver represents controlling media/cultural communication
          (read).<a id="ftnote-7-src" href="#ftnote-7">[7]</a> Famous of the Doctor's enemies include the 'Daleks',<a id="ftnote-8-src" href="#ftnote-8">[8]</a> who are a
          uniform martial race focused on racial purity and genocide (read), and the
          Cybermen, who are a similar uniform enemy who want to turn the masses into
          Cybermen and represent a force of Aryan ideology.

        <p><a id="ftnote-2" href="#ftnote-2-src">[2]</a>: Perhaps from 'Ra-sillion', where sillion means plowed soil, Ra the solar
          egyptian God, so perhaps this refers to Rasillion's role in preparing the way to
          plant the Aryan seed (read).
        </p>
        <p><a id="ftnote-3" href="#ftnote-3-src">[3]</a>: Perhaps chosen to intimate last-bornedness.
          Omega's original name was 'Peylix'. Perhaps from 'Peh' meaning mouth in hebrew,
          and 'lykos' meaning wolf in (ancient) Greek, as perhaps a jew who knew how to
          speak the language of the Aryan (and how to manipulate him thereby).
        </p>
        <p><a id="ftnote-4" href="#ftnote-4-src">[4]</a>: There
          is too much to say about all the Time Lord history and mythology in a summary
          like this.
        </p>
        <p><a id="ftnote-5" href="#ftnote-5-src">[5]</a>: Supposedly, Tardis is an acronym for time and relative dimension
          in space, but it is probably also 'Tar-Dis' referring to a kind of exploration
          ('Tar' meaning sailor) of the underworld ('Dis' referring to Dis Pater).
        </p>
        <p><a id="ftnote-6" href="#ftnote-6-src">[6]</a>: This is reminiscent of the opening of the ark of the covenant in Indiana Jones
          ROTLA, also suggesting Judaism is too dangerous to fully understand.
        </p>
        <p><a id="ftnote-7" href="#ftnote-7-src">[7]</a>: From
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_screwdriver#Functions">Wikipedia</a>: "The functions of a sonic screwdriver are based on its power over
          sound waves, radiation, wavelengths, frequencies, signals, and electromagnetism"
        </p>
        <p><a id="ftnote-8" href="#ftnote-8-src">[8]</a>: Again I think 'lykos' (wolf) inspires 'leks'. 'Da' is perhaps from 'Yes'
          which you see in many slavic languages, evoking 'yes-men' or obedient Aryans.
