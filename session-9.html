<h2>session 9</h2>

<p>The film session 9 by brad anderson is about Gordon's wife is having sex with Hank (the younger one with the moustache). She spills boiling water on Gordon's leg which is symbolic of a kind of castration and emasculation. Phil the ginger one is to Gordon what "Billy" is to Mary. He is Gordon's "eyes". Phil is a version of Gordon more in touch with reality. The question about paternity/cuckoldry is perhaps why Gordon kills the child.</p> 

<p>I think this is a fruitful point of view to parse more of the film, you can put a lot of stuff together, but I haven't got everything straight and I can't really be bothered. Maybe someone else can bring it home and solve it. Here are some other things I think feature in a solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
session 9 takes place largely in Gordon's mind and the asylum is a stage for recalling events in a dream-symbolic manner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gordon did work to cover-up his crimes. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Gordon's nephew represents a younger, uncorrupted version of himself, i.e. "innocence" like "Princess" to Mary.  
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Simon is some kind of demon archetype clearly and I love his line which is so evocative, "I live in the weak and the wounded". It reminds me of certain Jewish esotericists like Bronze Age Pervert/adjacent.</p>
